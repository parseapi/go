```bash
go get github.com/parseapi/go
```

```go
parse, err := parseapi.New("your-api-key")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
country, err := parse.Country(ctx, "US")
```

Import `parseapi "github.com/parseapi/go"`. Every call takes a `context.Context` first and returns a typed result plus an error. Check the error before using the result. Get a key at [parseapi.com](https://parseapi.com). An empty key reads `PARSEAPI_KEY`.

## Weather from a postal code

Start with the postal code, then pass its coordinates to weather. Reuse the client from the example above.

```go
place, err := parse.Postal(ctx, "28202", parseapi.PostalOptions{Country: "US"})
if err != nil {
    return err
}
if place.Latitude != nil && place.Longitude != nil {
    weather, err := parse.Weather(ctx, *place.Latitude, *place.Longitude)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Println(weather)
}
```

The coordinates represent the postal area. Weather is for that point. Missing coordinates skip the weather lookup. This composition performs two ordinary lookups when coordinates are available, with the retry policy below.

Import `fmt` for this example. Place it inside a function that returns `error`.

## Supply the context you know

Pass `country` when a postal code or national phone number needs disambiguation. A complete international phone number already carries its country context. For a numeric date such as `03/04/2026`, supply the intended `format`. Defaults resolve what the input establishes. Ambiguous input needs your context.

Results are plain data. Pass a returned code or coordinate to another operation when the task needs it. Check nullable values before composing the next call.

## Calls

Choose the operation and pass what you have. Related operations are separate direct calls, and results are plain data.

```go
country, err := parse.Country(ctx, "US")
states, err := parse.CountryStates(ctx, "US")
postal, err := parse.Postal(ctx, "28202", parseapi.PostalOptions{Country: "US"})
city, err := parse.City(ctx, "charlotte", parseapi.CityOptions{State: "NC", Country: "US"})
phone, err := parse.Phone(ctx, "+14155552671")
```

Optional query inputs use one options value. Omit it to use defaults. Use named fields, such as `PostalOptions{Country: "US"}`. Passing more than one options value returns an error before making a request. Every operation reserves its own options type, including operations whose options are currently empty. New optional fields can be added without changing calls or stored method signatures.

```go
parse.IP(ctx, "8.8.8.8", parseapi.IPOptions{Deep: true})
parse.Email(ctx, "hello@example.com", parseapi.EmailOptions{Deep: true})
parse.VAT(ctx, "DE136695976", parseapi.VATOptions{Deep: true})
parse.IBAN(ctx, "DE89370400440532013000")
parse.BIN(ctx, "424242")
parse.NPI(ctx, "1881018208")
parse.ASN(ctx, "AS13335")
parse.MAC(ctx, "00:1B:63:84:45:E6")
parse.Name(ctx, "Andrea", parseapi.NameOptions{Country: "IT"})
parse.VIN(ctx, "1HGCM82633A004352")
parse.Carrier(ctx, "+14155552671")
parse.Caller(ctx, "+18004633339")
parse.HLR(ctx, "+447712345678")
parse.UserAgent(ctx, "Mozilla/5.0")
parse.DNS(ctx, "example.com")
parse.DNS(ctx, "_dmarc.example.com", parseapi.DNSOptions{Type: "TXT"})
parse.NAICS(ctx, "541511")
parse.NAICSSearch(ctx, "coffee shop", parseapi.NAICSSearchOptions{Limit: 5})
parse.Tariff(ctx, "8471.30.01.00", parseapi.TariffOptions{Origin: "DE", Deep: true})
parse.Address(ctx, "123 Main St", parseapi.AddressOptions{Country: "US"})
parse.AddressSearch(ctx, "123 Main", parseapi.AddressSearchOptions{Country: "US", State: "NC"})
parse.Company(ctx, "123456789", parseapi.CompanyOptions{Country: "FR"})
parse.Date(ctx, "03/04/2026", parseapi.DateOptions{Format: "mdy"})
parse.DateToday(ctx, parseapi.DateTodayOptions{To: "2026-12-25"})
parse.Time(ctx, "") // UTC now
parse.Time(ctx, "America/New_York", parseapi.TimeOptions{At: "2026-09-05T15:00:00", To: "Asia/Tokyo"})
parse.TimeAt(ctx, 40.7128, -74.006)
parse.Weather(ctx, 40.7128, -74.006, parseapi.WeatherOptions{Deep: true, Date: "2026-09-01"})
```

NAICS records include classification `exclusions`, each with a description and linked codes. Generic exclusions can have no linked codes. Omitted or null exclusions in older responses remain unknown. Search results also include `match`: the matched `field` (`name`, `term` or `naics`) and `text`, plus `corrections` with `from` and `to` tokens for typo fallback. Corrections are empty for exact, plural and prefix matches. Direct code lookups omit `match`. Older responses may omit it.

Use named fields when constructing response values for fixtures too. Response and options structs reserve room for future fields and cannot be compared with `==`. Nullable values are pointers. Unknown JSON fields are accepted. An omitted `deep` is nil, a requested empty `deep` is a non-nil object, and unknown fields within it stay nil. Nullable arrays use nil slices.

DNS uses pooled requests on every plan. Omit `type` to check A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, SOA, CAA, SRV and PTR. Records contain `name`, `type`, `ttl` in seconds and a DNS presentation `value`. TXT values retain quoting and chunk boundaries. A selected question can include its CNAME chain. Empty records mean no records. Lookup failures remain errors.

## Time

`time` returns local ISO `at` with its UTC offset and integer Unix seconds in `unix`. `offset_seconds` is the exact offset, while `offset_minutes` is whole minutes. Historical offsets and ISO times can include offset seconds. Omitted `at` means now. With `to`, an offsetless `at` is source wall time. Otherwise it is UTC. Include an offset for repeated local times around a clock change. Current time and conversion use pooled requests on every plan. Coordinate clock fields can be null when the timezone is unknown. Existing `timezone` methods remain supported.

## Measurements

```go
result, err := client.Measure(ctx, "5 ft 11 in", parseapi.MeasureOptions{To: "cm"})
if err != nil { return err }
units, err := client.MeasureUnits(ctx, parseapi.MeasureUnitsOptions{Unit: "m"})
if err != nil { return err }
```

`amount` is a decimal string, such as `"180.34"`. Without `to`, the API returns the canonical unit for the measurement type. Pass `locale` for number formatting and `system` (`us` or `imperial`) when a customary unit needs context. Ambiguous input returns `valid: false`, a `reason`, and available `choices`. Invalid or incompatible target units use the normal API error.

Unit discovery accepts optional `query`, `type`, and `unit` filters. `unit` selects compatible targets. Omit the filters for the reviewed catalog. Both operations use pooled requests.

## Deep

Choose enrichment for the question you need answered.

| Operation | What `deep` requests |
|---|---|
| IP | Richer IP fields included with a paid plan. No separate check meter. |
| Email | A metered deliverability check, using included email checks or enabled on-demand usage. |
| VAT | A metered registry check where supported, using included VAT checks or enabled on-demand usage. |
| Phone | An empty object. Number parsing and formats are already in the core response. |

Carrier, caller, and HLR are separate metered operations. Choose them explicitly when you need their answers. Ordinary lookups retry twice by default. Metered checks use one attempt by default. Setting retries explicitly can repeat paid usage.

Without `deep`, the response omits that key. When requested, it is an empty object if access is locked or the operation has no deep fields. Otherwise it contains the available fields. A missing or null field means unknown.

## Errors

Every non-2xx response returns `*parseapi.Error` with `Status`, `Code`, `Message`, `Docs`, and `RequestID`. Branch on `Code`.

```go
_, err := parse.City(ctx, "atlantis")
var apiErr *parseapi.Error
if errors.As(err, &apiErr) && apiErr.Code == "not_found" {
    // No matching city.
}
```

Network failures, invalid JSON, and context cancellation retain their native Go error types. A failed call returns a nil result.

## Requests and retries

Create one client and share it across goroutines. A context deadline covers the whole call, including retry waits. The client timeout defaults to 10 seconds per attempt. Cancellation stops the request and any retry wait.

Ordinary lookups retry twice on network failures, 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504. Carrier, caller, and HLR calls use one attempt by default. Deep email, VAT, and address calls also use one attempt, reserving that behavior for address verification. Address deep currently returns an empty object. An explicit retry setting applies to every call, including metered operations. Additional attempts can be billed.

```go
parse, err := parseapi.New("your-api-key",
    parseapi.WithTimeout(5*time.Second),
    parseapi.WithRetries(0),
)
```

`WithRetries(0)` disables all automatic retries. Both numeric and HTTP-date `Retry-After` values are honored, capped at five seconds. Built-in requests do not follow redirects. `WithHTTPClient` copies your client and keeps redirects disabled. Custom transports must also keep credentials on the requested origin.

Requires Go 1.21 or later. Standard library only.

[Full endpoint and field reference](https://parseapi.com/docs)

BIN lookup accepts 6-11 digits as a string, including leading zeros. Spaces and hyphens are accepted. `prefix` is the actual longest match and can be shorter than the input. Unknown reference fields are null. `deep` adds an empty object on every plan.
